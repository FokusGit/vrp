# Job clustering

Sometimes, the problem definition has jobs which are close to each other, so it makes sense to serve them together at
the same stop. However, typically, job's service time includes extra time costs such as parking, loading/unloading,
which should be considered only once in the solution. A `clustering` property inside `plan` specifies the properties
of the custom vicinity clustering algorithm which supposed to help in such scenarios and some others.
